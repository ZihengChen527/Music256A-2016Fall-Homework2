Sound Painter

My idea is to implement a sound painter which can compose music by painting. Three basic waveforms(square, triangle, sawtooth) are pigments for painting. You can paint and compose by dragging mouse on the canvas.

On canvas, Y-axis determines the frequency. X-axis determines how many sinusoid partials are used to generate the waveform(square, triangle, or sawtooth). So dragging the mouse from left to right will increase the total partial number, and dragging it from bottom to top will increase the pitch. You can "paint" with each waveform alone, or with them together.
